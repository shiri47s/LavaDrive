To obtain the Blessing of Lava, you must equip **a full set of Lava series**.

## Added NEW ores and NEW upgrade template

NEW ores will now be produced at a slightly lower rate than diamonds in the deeper levels of the overworld (around **-30 or less in height**).

NEW upgrade templates can be found in chests in **treasure room of the bastion remnant**. That can be duplicated just like any other template. Duplication uses the new ores, **not diamonds**.
